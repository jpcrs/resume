\cvsection{About me}
\begin{txtx}
I consider myself a developer that likes simple solutions, not a fan of overengineering. I've worked on different projects on different fields, like Telecom, Banking, IoT, Networking, etc, mainly working as a backend engineer. I have programming as a hobby, especially learning new technologies and messing with reverse engineering, but besides that also like to spend my time reading, trying to learn music, playing games or just staying with family and friends.
